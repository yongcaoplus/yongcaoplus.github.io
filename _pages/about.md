I'm Yong Cao, currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [Autonomous Vision Group (AVG)](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/autonomous-vision/home/), [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/), supervised by [Andreas Geiger](https://www.cvlibs.net/). I obtained my Ph.D. degreee at [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn/) in 2024 under the supervision of [Min Chen](https://people.ece.ubc.ca/~minchen/). From October 2022 to May 2024, I was a visiting Ph.D. student at the University of Copenhagen, supervised by [Daniel Hershcovich](https://danielhers.github.io/). I earned my bachelor’s degree from Sichuan University in 2018. 

My research focuses on scientific document analysis, including multimodal document understanding, summarization, impact prediction, and scientific document generation. Additionally, I am also interested in cultural adaptation in large language models, particularly in areas such as cross-cultural generation and social value alignment.
